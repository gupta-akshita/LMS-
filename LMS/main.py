# System Requirements

# We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the Library Management System:
# 1. Any library member should be able to search books by their title, author, subject category as well by the publication date.
# 2. Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to locate the book.
# 3. There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.
# 4. The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
# 5. There should be a maximum limit on how many books a member can check-out.
# 6. The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.
# 7. Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
# 8. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become
# available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.
# 9. The system will be able to read barcodes from books and membersâ€™ library cards.
